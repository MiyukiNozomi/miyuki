		<h1>Hello, my name is [REDACTED],<br/> and i started programming for
			real in 2019.</h1>
		<p>
			The First Programming Language that i started learning was C++, and
			after 3 weeks i went into another language called BatchScript,<br />
			<br /> After Batch, i then got in a language called C#, and well, i
			stayed in that language for just 3 days. (i had a really bad
			experince.)<br />
			<br /> And, i was almost giving up about programming, when i found
			Java, java was special because it was the first language that i used
			for real. (you can see that by about 90% of my github repositories
			having java as a main language), <br />
			<br /> after soo much time, i found D, with is a really good
			language.<br />
			<br /> now in 2021, i got back into C++, and now its for real.<br />
